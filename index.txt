        <h4>After studying information management for 3 years at the UITM Rembau campus, I received my diploma one month ago. For the first time, I'm looking for a full-time work. Before going to university, I worked for a year as a sales assistant at a veil store as an employee. I'm not sure where I'll be in five years or what my long-term professional objectives will be. I don't have enough professional expertise to guarantee that the world is changing at the rate it is. However, I am confident in my ability to provide fresh ideas and innovative methods to any project I work on. Challenges and constructive criticism are always welcome in my professional life. I have a wide range of interests and am able to adapt rapidly to new situations. At the same time, I want to be part of a team that develops high-quality and original goods</h4>
           <p>My target for next 5 years:</p>
            <ul class="a">
              <li>Have the presence of a stable career</li>
              <li>Fulfilling parents' wishes, is doing Hajj</li>
              <li>Vacation with family around the world</li>
